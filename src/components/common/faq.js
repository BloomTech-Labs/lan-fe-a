        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <p className='question'>What is viewee?</p>
        <p className='answer'>viewee is a platform that allows Lambda School students to answer, view, and post job interview questions to prepare for the real thing.</p>
        <p className='question'>Why viewee?</p>
        <p className='answer'>I felt there wasn't a platform who's sole purpose was about interview questions. Often it was tacked on to job and interview preparation sites and not really given much focus.</p>

        <p className='answer'>Extremely easy. You can register in seconds and immediately start viewing, answering, and posting questions.</p>

        <p className='answer'><a href='https://github.com/miugel' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Miguel</a></p>
        <p className='question'>What tech stack are you using?</p>
        <p className='answer'>React and styled-components on the front end and Express and Postgres on the back end.</p>
        <p className='question'>How can I get involved?</p>
