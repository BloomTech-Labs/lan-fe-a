                      <p>The core principle of this community platform is to give ü§≤</p>
                      <p>We believe that ‚Äúgiving back‚Äù is the key to unlocking the potential of every Lambda student and alum. Here‚Äôs why:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Take a look at the #hired channel on Slack. Each story is unique and moving for its own reason, but every story calls attention to the idea that ‚Äúit takes a village.‚Äù</li>
                        <li>This community has already helped so many of us. That said, many of us know deep down that together, we have an incredible capacity to do so much more.</li>
                        <li>This community has the capacity to move mountains. We built this platform to better unleash that capacity.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <h2>Why this, and not Slack, Reddit, Discord, Circle, etc.?</h2>
                      <p>This is a great question üòä Here are a few reasons why we decided not to use a third-party app:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Slack‚Äîand a few other community platforms‚Äîare very synchronous, in nature. This means that if you don‚Äôt login or open the app for a few days, you might completely miss a conversation that could have had a huge impact on you, or your career.</li>
                        <li>Other community platforms have poor search capabilities. Search is important because fatigue is real, and nobody can hope to provide the same material over and over again ad stay useful.</li>
                        <li>Lastly, we think that it is both good and important to build things üõ†</li>

                      <p>Your profile is incredibly important. It is how other Lambda grads will identify you.</p>
                      <p>Please make sure to accurately identify your cohort, your company (if you have a job), your title, and how you prefer to be contacted.</p>
                      <p>There are now thousands of Lambda alumni, all around the world.  Keep in mind that some of them have been working for nearly three years, while some have just started looking for their first job in tech.</p>
                      <p>We want this place to work for everyone. Nobody‚Äôs path is linear. Keep your profile up-to-date, and it will make it much easier for everyone to feel connected.</p>
